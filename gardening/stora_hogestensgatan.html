<h1> Summary </h1>
<p/>
<p> Next to where we live, in our tiny cluster of apartment buildings, is this very small piece of land that the land lord (MKB) has designated for tennants to grow whatever they want </p>
<p><a href="https://www.suncalc.org/#/55.5727,12.9349,19/2021.04.12/13:09/1/1" target="_blank">You can see the lot here</a>. As you can see, it does get some sun, but most of it is hidden in the shadow of the building to the south. Regardless, it should be getting enough sun for the planned plants. </p>
<p> My plan is to try and grow some native edible plants for anyone to pickup and eat </p>
<p> I also plan to try and implement some permaculture techniques to keep the garden going with minimal effort </p>

<p> This is the piece of land </p>

<p> You can see at the bottom right there a laminated piece of paper I've set up that explains what im trying to do in Swedish & English, and has a QR code that points to here </p>
<p> The reason for this is that even though this is supposed to be the spot where (the tennants) grow things, the company that maintains the lawns around the buildings has come through before and removed / killed all flowers we've planted "because they thought they were weeds". No Comment. :| </p>
<p> As you can see from the image above, we have 10 strawberry plants. They have been moved there from our "greenhouse" style balcony on week 12 of this year (2021). They have endured a very harsh winter this year without too much sign of stress, so I have good hopes for them enduring the swedish winters fine. </p>

<p> There is also a small apple tree sapling that we germinated from seed last year (2020), around week 24. There was another apple tree there, but it was not as hardy, and did not survive the harsh winter we got this year. </p>
<p> This one, however, seems to have endured and is just now waking up again </p>
<p> The small fence is to keep away tiny rodents from eating it over winter </p>

<p> In the near future, the plan is to suppliment the lot with some Ringblommor (Swedish for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula_officinalis" target="_blank">Calendula Offcinalis, or Scottish Marigolds</a>) kindly donated to us by two of our friends (If you're reading this, thanks Juffy & Seb :). </p>
<p> My daughters & I have planted them in germinating pots a week ago, and they are in the balcony right now getting ready for transplantion (maybe in a week). </p>

<p> I moved all nine planter pots outside and arranged them around the lot </p>

<p> I have started experimenting a little with the marigolds. </p>
<p> Originally, I had all nine planter pots outside, as you can see in the previous entry's image. </p>
<p> However, due to my innate ability to ever leave something as it is, I started wondering if this was the best method to get some nice marigolds :). So, I took one of the nine planters and moved the seedlings directly into the ground</p>
<p><img src="../images/sh/ringblommor_20210417_direct_sow.jpg" alt="the marigolds sown directly into the soil" /></p>

<p> Now most people would be content with this kind of experimentation, however, patience has never been a virtue of mine.</p>
<p>Today as I was going about the house, I noticed that inside one of the planters where we are growing Kiwi from seed (long story, dont ask :D) one Marigold seedling had sprouted. And not just sprouted, but this seedling, growing under an ikea growth light for 16 hours a day, seems to be progressing much faster than the ones outside. </p>
<p>This is not very surprising, as it has not yet been very sunny here in Sweden, so as of April 21st, the artificial light trumps sunlight, especially in the lot where it gets a lot of shade from the surrounding buildings.</p>
<p><img src="../images/sh/ringblommor_20210421_superbloom.jpg" alt="the marigold growing under artificial growth light. Please ignore the kiwi plant next to it :)" /></p>

<p> So, I have moved three planters of the marigolds indoors, under the growth lights. </p>

<p> I will continue to monitor the progress on the 3 different batches (Indoor under growth light, outdoor in a pot, outdoor direct in the soil) and try and see which batch will fare best, to try and optimise planting for next year. </p>

<p> The plan is to one day pair these results with weather data as well as some sensors in order to try and match these conditions and try and train a NN that would predict the best times and methods for planting the different plants based on time of year and weather conditions and forecast... </p>
<p> But that is a different story for a different day :) </p>
